# Distance-Diagnosis - Tackling neglected health cases
Web Service that implements a multiple ML models to determine if users could be diagnosable for one of 5 of Australia's late treated diseases. 

In Australia, Lung Cancer, Bowel Cancer, COPD, Chronic Kidney Disease, and Dementia are the 5 diseases most commonly diagnosed late. As someone who has grown up rurally I know all too well how the barriers to accessibile health in rural australia can effect residents, providing an easily accessible service that can assist in diagnosing these diseases earlier can potentially not only save the lives of rural residents, but residents in urban areas struggling to receive healthcare as a result of systematic healthgcare challenges.
